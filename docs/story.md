# The Triumph and the Binding
The underground civilization called themselves the Mer. They were miners, philosophers, architects who descended into the earth fleeing some forgotten surface calamity. In the deep dark, they found the Wellspring - a vast reservoir of anima, the raw essence of souls. Through centuries of study, they learned to manipulate it, to weave it into their bodies, to achieve what every civilization dreams of: victory over death itself.
The Binding was their greatest achievement. A network of anchors throughout their cities, crystallized nodes of anima that tethered every soul to the underground. When a Mer died, their anima would flow back to the Wellspring, reconstitute, and return them to life at the nearest anchor. No more grief. No more loss. An eternity to perfect their crafts, their relationships, their society.
For a time, it was paradise.
# The Fraying
But souls were never meant to be recycled endlessly. Each death wears at the anima, like water wearing at stone. The first signs were subtle - memories that wouldn't quite settle, emotions that felt muted, as if experienced through thick glass. Some Mer began dying repeatedly, intentionally, testing their immortality. They always came back, but each time a little less.
The Wellspring itself began to sicken. Its luminous depths turned murky. The anchors, once warm with life, grew cold and hungry. Some Mer stopped coming back whole - they'd revive missing pieces of themselves, gaps in their souls that could never be filled.
And the worst realization: the Binding cannot be undone. The architects who created it died and returned so many times they forgot how they built it. The knowledge scattered across ten thousand fragmented minds. The underground became not a sanctuary but a tomb where nothing can truly end.
# Factions of the Endless
The Seekers still search for a way to break the Binding. They've become archaeologists of their own civilization, piecing together fragments of the original rituals. Many have died hundreds of times in their experiments. Their leader, the Hollow Sage, is barely a whisper of consciousness, but refuses to stop seeking.
The Embrace believes the Binding is salvation, that the fraying is a test of faith. They die ritually, joyfully, certain that each return brings them closer to transcendence. They're wrong - they're the most deteriorated of all, their minds looping through the same thoughts, the same prayers, unable to recognize their own decay.
The Quiet Ones have simply stopped. They sit in the ancient districts, not dead but not living, having exhausted every possible thought and feeling across countless lifetimes. Some have been sitting for centuries. They don't starve, don't age, don't move. Just exist, trapped in the awful middle space.
The Wardens guard the Wellspring itself, believing that if it dies, everyone dies permanently - and they're probably right. But the Wellspring is failing. The Wardens know this. They've become zealots, attacking anyone who threatens the fragile equilibrium, even as they watch the light dim year by year.
# Places of Power and Sorrow
## The First Anchor
Where the Binding began. A cathedral-like space of impossible geometry, its walls covered in the names of every Mer who's ever lived. But the names repeat, thousands of times, each inscription growing shakier, less certain. At its center, the original anchor pulses weakly, covered in cracks.
## The Garden of Remembering
The Mer tried to preserve their memories externally, planting crystal flowers that store experiences. But memory flowers need living souls to tend them, and the gardeners have forgotten why they garden. The flowers are dying, thousands of years of joy and sorrow evaporating into the dark.
## The Depths of Failed Returns
Where the Wellspring spits out those who've died too many times to reconstitute properly. Partial people, fragments of consciousness, echoes that whisper pieces of forgotten lives. They're not alive enough to die, not dead enough to end. The Mer try not to think about this place.
## The Locked Archives
The accumulated knowledge of an immortal society. Philosophy, science, art perfected over millennia. But it's locked, because someone decided certain knowledge was too dangerous. Problem is, the keyholders have all frayed beyond recognition. An eternity of wisdom, useless.
# The Mechanics of Anima
Your character is newly returned, fresher than most, which is why you can still move with purpose. Each death costs you something permanent - perhaps skills degrade, perhaps you lose access to certain dialogue options as your ability to connect fades, perhaps the world itself becomes less vibrant as your capacity to perceive it dims.
Boss souls could be concentrated anima from those who died so many times they collapsed into singular, massive beings - all their lives compressed into one tortured existence. Defeating them doesn't kill them, just scatters them back to the Wellspring where they'll eventually reform, trapped in their own cycle.

# Mer, the Sunken Triumph
The name itself has degraded - scholars debate whether it was once "Mera," "Merul," or "Memoria." The citizens who remember the original name have died so many times the memory blurs with contradictory certainties. Now it's just Mer. Short, blunt, like something worn smooth.

# Visual Degradation System
Your first life in Mer is crystal clear. The bioluminescent fungi glow in distinct blues and greens. You can read the inscriptions on walls. NPC faces have definition - you can see the weariness in their eyes, the minute expressions that make them human.
Each death layers fog over your perception:
- Deaths 1-5: Colors begin to desaturate slightly. Sharp edges soften. You start noticing visual artifacts at the periphery - ghostly afterimages of your previous deaths, faint silhouettes where you once stood.
- Deaths 6-15: Text becomes harder to read, letters swimming slightly. NPC dialogue options shorten because you can't quite remember complex conversation threads. The architecture of Mer starts feeling repetitive - did that archway always look like the other one, or are you losing the ability to distinguish?
- Deaths 16-30: Significant color loss. The world takes on a grey-blue wash, like viewing everything through murky water. Character models blur at the edges. You sometimes forget which direction you were heading. Environmental storytelling becomes harder to parse because the details fade.
- Deaths 31-50: Heavy vignetting. The edges of your screen darken constantly. Colors are almost entirely gone except for the sickly glow of anima - it's the only thing that stays vibrant, which becomes its own horror. You're forgetting NPC names. The subtitles show "[Forgotten Merchant]" or "[Someone You Knew]."
- Deaths 51+: Extreme blur except for a small circle of clarity in the center of your vision. Sounds muffle and echo. Music layers become stripped away until only a single mournful melody remains. You occasionally respawn at the wrong anchor because you can't remember where you last died. Boss encounters you've completed before feel unfamiliar - did you fight this thing already?
- Deaths 100+: The game becomes almost abstract. Mer is now just shapes and light and darkness. NPCs are silhouettes. Dialogue is fragmented. The only thing that remains perfectly clear is the combat - muscle memory, the last thing to fade. You are becoming like the Quiet Ones, going through motions you no longer understand.

# Memory Mechanics
The game could track specific memories tied to each area or NPC:

The first time you meet someone, you get their full backstory
The second encounter after several deaths, you remember them but not their name
Later, you recognize them only as "familiar"
Eventually, they're just another shape in Mer

Your quest log degrades too. Early game: "The Hollow Sage requested I find three fragments of the original Binding ritual in the Archive of Echoes." After many deaths: "Find... something. Archive?" Late game: "???"
But here's the cruel twist - the game itself remembers. If you check your actual stats screen (maybe accessed through a specific mirror item that shows truth), you can see pristine records of everything you've done, everyone you've met, every place you've been. The knowledge exists, but you can't access it anymore. It's locked behind the fog of your degraded anima.

# Mer's Geography
Upper Mer - "The Living Districts" - Where those with fewer deaths still maintain something like society. Markets with no customers. Performance halls where actors perform to empty seats because they've forgotten audiences were once necessary. Least degraded, still has color and life, but hollow.
The Spirals - Massive helical staircases descending through Mer's levels. As you go deeper, you're traveling both physically downward and backward through time - the architecture grows more ancient, more grand, showing Mer at its height. But also more decayed, because the oldest districts have been abandoned the longest.
The Wellspring Depths - Where the light comes from. But the light is wrong now, pulsing irregularly, sometimes surging bright enough to hurt, sometimes dimming to almost nothing. The closer you get, the more the blur effect actually lessens - being near pure anima temporarily sharpens your perception. This makes it both sanctuary and trap.
The Outskirts of Forgetting - The edges of Mer where the anchors no longer function properly. If you die here, you might not come back at all, or come back wrong. The most degraded Mer drift here, hoping for true death. It's the only place in the game where the permadeath might actually be permanent - but you can never be certain.
The name "Mer" also evokes "mere" - as in "merely," reduced to something less. And "mer" - the sea, drowning, submersion. All fitting for a sunken city where its people drown in immortality.
